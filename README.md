## MyRPG

Welcome to "MyFarmer" RPG! This project was developed by Romain Collignon, Theo Lemaire, and myself. MyFarmer is a pixel art farming simulator RPG created as part of our first-year project. The game is built in C and provides a complete and engaging experience with various features and technical implementations. We used the CSFML librairy to create it. 

The code is not the cleanest, but im proud of it as a first year project
